# Depth-First-Search
The goal of a graph traversal, generally, is to find all nodes reachable from a given set of root nodes. In an undirected graph we follow all edges; in a directed graph we follow only out-edges.

This project includes

1. depth-first search
2. cycle detection
3. topological sort
4. identifying strongly connected components
